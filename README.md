# Keyword_Extractor
I was given an NLP report project for my Intro To Python and Machine Learning Class. This project did not require coding, however I wanted to make something to prove my understanding on my research. I made a Keyword Extractor that extracts keywords from webpages, and stores them in a separate file that the user can see.
